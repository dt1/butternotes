  <h4>Cypress TT-15 (Free Plugin)</h4>

  <p>I am huge fan or Orange amps and cabs. The only hardware amp I own is and Orange, which replaced
    a prior Orange amp. I own the AmpliTube OrangeÂ® collection. Black Rooster has offered a fine
    sim of the Tiny Terror amp in the Cypress TT-15.</p>
  <p>However, like all Black Rooster plugins I own, the Cypress excels at exactly one thing, which is
    the amp. The cab is, to put it lightly, awful, and for this reason, I seldom use this plugin, or
    really, any of Black Rooster's plugins I own.</p>
  <p>This difference in amp and cab quality shows the challenge of using free plugins. Sometimes,
    a buyer will get something awesome, but she will be wanting something else to enhance her
    production. While some stock cabs are very good, getting the cab tones that work well with an
    Orange and other known amps proves to be difficult, if not impossible. In my own testing and
    research, I have found no good free cab plugins. Some are better than others, but none are
    really up to what I would like in my productions.</p>
  <p>With all that said, I do not want to spend my time writing reviews for products that I believe
    are a waste of time to use, and I certainly do not think the Cypress TT-15 is a waste of time
    to own and use. I think of this as a great entry into the world of amp sims. I really do wish
    that Black Rooster did not include the cab switch in this plugin, because it truly is a fine
    and convincing amp sim.</p>
  <p>If you aren't sure about the world of amp sims, or you don't have the money to drop on a paid
    collection of amp sims, downloading the Cypress will be worth your while. You will have to figure
    out a good cab plugin.</p>
