<h1>Xfer OTT (Free Plugin)</h1>

<p>The Xfer OTT is a free plugin from the same company that has created Serum and
  Cthulu, both which have found their way into endless productions ranging across
  nearly all genres of music. Likewise, the OTT has also found it's way into
  many productions, for good reason: it is amazing.</p>
<p>As an Ableton user, I thinks it's fair to compare this the stock OTT plugin,
  which is highly regarded within the production community. One can reasonably
  argue that the Ableton OTT is the best stock plugin Ableton offers.</p>
<p>Considering the high-quality of Ableton's stock version, one may wonder
  why one would prefer to use Xfer's OTT instead. In my opninion, there are
  two distinct sound-scapes each plugin offers:</p>
<p>* Ableton offers a smooth OTT that pulls out the sonic bands without adding
  distortion.</p>
<p>* While Xfer's OTT works similar to Ableton's OTT, I prefer to use the Xfer when I am
  looking to add smooth distortion to certain bands. The OTT is a good piece of software
  to add to clean and dirty signal chains to either
  clean up or tame distortion.<p/>
<p>In my opinion, everyone should own this plugin, and for free, there is
  no reason to not own this one.</p>
