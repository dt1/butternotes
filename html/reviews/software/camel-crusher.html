<h1>Camel Crusher (Free Plugin)</h1>

<p>The CamelCrusher is legendary, finding it's way on a long
  list of professionally-produced albums.</p>
<p>CamelCrusher is the minimized version of CamelPhat. Both plugins were
  created by the now-defunct Camel Audio.</p>
<p>CamelCrusher is predominantly used to add a little or a lot
  of distortion to your tracks. It comes with a variety of presets
  like "American Crunch," "Bass Maker," and "Tube Warmth." These
  presets could give one the impression that CamelCrusher attempts
  to be an amp sim. In my attempts to use it as an amp or cab sim, this
  plugin didn't do very well.</p>
<p>What it does do is give a nice boost of energy or filth to your tracks.
  It can also serve as a fine glue compressor for a group of tracks.<p>
<p>CamelCrusher installers can be found on various parts of the internet
  for free. I'm not going to link to any particular site. Just be
  careful with any installer you run on your computer.</p>
