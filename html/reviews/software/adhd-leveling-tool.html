<p>The ADHD Leveling Tool is is a tube leveling amplifier seemingly inpsired by the LA-2A,
  TLA-100, and similar leveling amplifier (LA) plugins and hardware, but with a few extra buttons and settings.</p>
<p>In order to understand this or any leveling amplifier, we have to establish what
  they are doing exactly. While they do give a boost to your audio, they aren't
  gain or utility tools: these are compressors.</p>
<p>The ADHD was one of the first non-stock compressors I've ever used. After using stock compressors
  for several months, this compressor changed how I think about and approach compression.</p>
<p>The ADHD website describes this plugin as "the ideal compressor for vocals." While I agree
  with this in part, I do want to point out that this compressor is very good for guitars and
  other instruments as well. This doesn't mean that I disagree with the idea of using this
  for vocals; I prefer to use 1176 compressors in parallel for vocals. </p>
<p>This compressor does a great job of compressing audio without making it obvious. While it
  serves as a good smoothing tool, it also can add a lot of heat and damage to your audio if
  that is the sound you are going for. Most importantly, the audio does amplify without making
  a mess of the audio.</p>
