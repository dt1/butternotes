  <h4>Izotope Vinyl (Free Plugin)</h4>
  <img src="https://items.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/reviews/plugins/izotope-vinyl.png">
  <p>Quite often, you'll hear someone say she uses Izotope Vinyl
    on "everything," and it's not hard to understand why this
    may be the case, if one is so inclined to add a bit
    of dusty vintage to her tracks.</p>
  <p>This plugin has a wide variety of warped vinyl, ranging from
    completely busted to a soft bit of warp. Another
    feature is the <i>spin down</i> button, which sounds like
    someone is stopping the record without taking the needle off.</p>
  <p>Each button and slider does
    exactly what it advertises, and the user interface is simple
    enough that anyone can look at it and figure out what it does.</p>
  <p>What isn't obvious is the high quality audio that this plugin
    creates. If you aren't familiar with the Izotope collection of
    plugins, this is a great entry into the company's products.
    This is one of the few free plugins that is sigificantly better
    than stock.</p>
  <p>For the price of $0, you really can't go wrong by
    downloading this.</p>
  <p>This plugin is available in VST, VST3, 64-bit
    AAX, AU, and 32-bit RTAS.</p>
