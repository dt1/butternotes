  <h3>Welcome to butternotes.com</h3>
  <p>This site is a revival of the original Butternotes webiste and my defunct blog, {:code redux}.</p>
  <h4>From {:code redux}</h4>
  <p>I ported Music Theory for (Non)Musicians and (Non)Programmers from {:code redux}. I'm currently
    updating the articles with updated graphics, code examples, and (hopefully) better writing.</p>
  <p>These are the current articles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://butternotes.com/on-programming/cof-one">The Circle of Fifths, Part One</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://butternotes.com/on-programming/cof-two">The Circle of Fifths, Part Two</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://butternotes.com/on-programming/chords-one">Building Chords, Part One</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h4>From the original butternotes site</h4>
  <p>The notation software I'm using for the sheet music has been updated with new software.</p>
  <p>This project has been a relatively large rewrite, and old features, such as the metronome and random
    sheet music generator are coming along soon.</p>
  <h4>New Features</h4>
  <p>The original butternotes had a lot of articles that aren't relevant to music. Other articles were
    okay for the time, but are not longer relevant to the goals of this webiste. Instead, reviews of
    plugins, hardware, and instruments I use will be added. The first to come in will be the software.</p>
